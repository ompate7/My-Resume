# My Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website built with React and Vite, featuring a Windows 11 inspired user interface.

This portfolio is designed to showcase my skills and projects in an interactive and engaging way, mimicking a familiar desktop environment.

## Features

- **Windows 11 Inspired Desktop Environment:** A unique user interface that simulates the look and feel of Windows 11.
- **Interactive and Draggable Windows:** Different sections of the portfolio (like About, Projects, etc.) are presented in resizable and draggable windows.
- **Integrated VS Code-like Editor:** Includes a functional code editor powered by Monaco Editor, allowing users to run JavaScript snippets directly within the portfolio.
- **Functional Music Player:** A compact music player with playback controls, progress bar, and volume adjustment.
- **Responsive Design:** While best viewed on a desktop, the layout is adapted for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast frontend build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Monaco Editor (`@monaco-editor/react`):** The code editor that powers VS Code, embedded in the application.
- **React Icons (`react-icons`):** A library providing popular icon packs as React components.

## Setup and Running Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd portfolio
    ```

    *Replace `<your_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.*

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can view the website in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.
